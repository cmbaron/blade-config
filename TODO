Objectives:
- microk8s install running after fs is running ro
     - this is from provider-microk8s, the go code itself writes the script with stage "boot.before", but it needs to be stage "fs" for microk8s to update state 
- figure out provider-microk8s composition
   - layer provider-microk8s on top of provider-baronos (fork of provider-kairos)
   - DONE build a new base image, layer
     - (~DONE) debug microk8s not starting (assume is dirty downgrade)
     - debug upgrade not working
- try fresh install
   + Found:
     - install with cloud config succeeds, then falls into manual install
   - watch for 
     - ssh key change   
     - machine-id instability
- run workload in cluster (to help dev?)
- automated build, releases
- automated upgrade, watching release channel
- central ops
  -dup? microk8s administration - syncing config
  -dup? get kubernetes config from cloud
  - get cloud-config from cloud
- console splash screen 
- figure out where kairos user is coming from

pending:
- machine-id is not secure to use - opened issue under yip

Out of scope:
- secure boot
- client/server -- AWS Bluegrass
   - control api
   - data apis
- lambdas

- switched to microk8s
- system upgrade controller from microk8s

- get local or oem config from git
   - datasources
